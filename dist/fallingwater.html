												<h1>Fallingwater</h1>
												<p>Fallingwater is a house designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935 in rural southwestern Pennsylvania,
													43 miles (69 km) southeast of Pittsburgh.The house was built partly over a waterfall on Bear Run in the Mill Run section of Stewart Township,
													Fayette County, Pennsylvania, located in the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains.
													The house was designed as a weekend home for the family of Liliane and Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., owner of Kaufmann's Department Store.</p>
												<h2>History</h2>
												<p>At age 67, Frank Lloyd Wright was given the opportunity to design and construct three buildings. With his three works of the late 1930s—Fallingwater;
													the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin; and the Herbert Jacobs house in Madison, Wisconsin—Wright regained his prominence in the architectural community.</p>
