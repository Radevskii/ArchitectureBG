# ArchitectureBG
This is a small course work for WEBDev class. I made a not very good looking site, but i tried my best(or i think I did).
The idea of this site is to show people what kind of structures are moderne these days. Here you can find the most inovative architects for our century. 

How to run:
- `npm i install`
